# Open Source Sandbox

This repository is for you to try out the open source software workflow.
There is no code here, just this readme file. But that's enough to practice all the steps. 

Go ahead and:

* Fork this repository
* On your fork, change the readme file by putting in anything you want at the bottom (you can simply say hi).
* Open a pull request so that I can merge your changes.
